This software was a simplified remake of https://github.com/rodschulz/BPA.
Alors, pour Ball Pivoting Algorithm.

When I tried to use the original version, there were always problems in compilation and execution. 
It was also not very pcl-friendly with custom data types and OFF-format output. 

In this software, basically all geometrical data is in pcl-formats, and it can be used as pure header library. 
OpenMP and CUDA are not supported.
